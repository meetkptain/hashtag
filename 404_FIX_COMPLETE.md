# 404 Error Fixed - Frontend Built Successfully! ✅

## Problem

After fixing the Apache errors, you were getting a **404 Not Found** error at `http://localhost/`

## Root Cause

The application uses **Inertia.js + Vue.js** for the frontend, and the assets hadn't been built yet. When Laravel tried to load the page, the Vite assets were missing, causing a 404.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ❌ Missing Node Modules
**Problem**: `node_modules` directory didn't exist  
**Solution**: Ran `npm install` to install all frontend dependencies

### 2. ❌ Vue Syntax Error  
**Problem**: Invalid HTML tag in `Welcome.vue` (line 61 had `<h3>` tag but closed with `</p>`)  
**Solution**: Fixed the tag mismatch:
```vue
<!-- Before (WRONG) -->
<h3 class="text-gray-600">Chargement asynchrone...</h3>

<!-- After (CORRECT) -->
<p class="text-gray-600">Chargement asynchrone...</p>
```

### 3. ❌ Assets Not Built  
**Problem**: Frontend assets weren't compiled  
**Solution**: Ran `npm run build` successfully

### For Development (Hot Reload)

Run this command to get hot module replacement while developing:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then access: `http://localhost` (Apache will proxy to Vite dev server)

### For Production

The assets are already built! Just use:
```
http://localhost
```

To rebuild after making changes:
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Your Application

Visit these pages to verify everything works:

- ✅ **Homepage**: `http://localhost/`
- ⚠️ **Login**: `http://localhost/login` (needs database)
- ⚠️ **Register**: `http://localhost/register` (needs database)

### 2. Set Up Database

The authentication and dashboard features require a database:

**Step 1: Create Database**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE social_wall CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

**Step 2: Configure `.env`**
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=social_wall
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**Step 3: Run Migrations**
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 3. Configure Social Media APIs

To enable the social wall features, add your API credentials to `.env`:

```env
# Facebook
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_app_id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret

# Instagram  
INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Twitter/X
TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Google Reviews
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

### 4. Configure Stripe (for payments)

```env
STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```
